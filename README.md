# NATS Manager
Manages the lifecycle of a NATS JetStream deployment.

## Description
It is a standard Kubernetes operator which observes the state of NATS JetStream deployment and reconciles its state according to desired state.

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

This project is scaffolded using [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io), and all the Kubebuilder `makefile` helpers mentioned [here](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/makefile-helpers.html) can be used.

## Development

### Pre-requisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/)
- [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)
- Access to Kubernetes cluster ([k3d](https://k3d.io/) / k8s)

### Running locally
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:
    ```sh
    make install
    ```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):
    ```sh
    make run
    ```

    **NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Running tests
Run the unit and integration tests:
```sh
make test-only
```

### Linting
1. Fix common lint issues:
    ```sh
    make imports-local
    make fmt-local
    ```

2. Run lint check:
    ```sh
    make lint-thoroughly
    ```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

### Build container images

Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<container-registry>/nats-manager:<tag> # If using docker, <container-registry> is your username.
```

**NOTE**: Run the following for MacBook M1 devices:
```sh
make docker-buildx IMG=<container-registry>/nats-manager:<tag>
```

## Deployment
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [k3d](https://k3d.io/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Deploying on the cluster

1. Install the CRDs to the cluster:
    ```sh
    make install
    ```
2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

   ```sh
   make docker-build docker-push IMG=<container-registry>/nats-manager:<tag>
   ```

3. Deploy the `nats-manager` controller to the cluster:
    ```sh
    make deploy IMG=<container-registry>/nats-manager:<tag>
    ```

4. [Optional] Install NATS Custom Resource:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f config/samples/eventing-nats-eval.yaml
    ```

**Undeploy controller**

Undeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

**Uninstall CRDs**

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Deploying using [Kyma Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/kyma-project/lifecycle-manager/tree/main)
1. Deploy the Lifecycle Manager & Module Manager to the Control Plane cluster with:

```shell
kyma alpha deploy
```

**NOTE**: For single-cluster mode edit the lifecycle manager role to give access to all resources with `kubectl edit clusterrole lifecycle-manager-manager-role` and have the following under `rules`:
```shell
- apiGroups:                                                                                                                                                  
  - "*"                                                                                                                                                       
  resources:                                                                                                                                                  
  - "*"                                                                                                                                                       
  verbs:                                                                                                                                                      
  - "*"
```

2. Prepare OCI container registry:

It can be Github, DockerHub, GCP or local registry. 
The following resources worth having a look to set up a container registry unless you have one:
* Lifecycle manager [provision-cluster-and-registry](https://github.com/kyma-project/lifecycle-manager/blob/main/docs/developer/provision-cluster-and-registry.md) documentation
* [Github container registry documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry). Change the visibility of a GH package to public if you don't provide a registry secret.

3. Generate module template and push container image by running the following command in the project root director:
```sh
kyma alpha create module -n kyma-project.io/module/nats --version 0.0.1 --registry ghcr.io/{GH_USERNAME}/nats-manager -c {REGISTRY_USER_NAME}:{REGISTRY_AUTH_TOKEN} -w
```
In the command GH container registry sample is used. Replace GH_USERNAME=REGISTRY_USER_NAME and REGISTRY_AUTH_TOKEN with the GH username and token/password respectively.

The command generates a ModuleTemplate `template.yaml` file in the project folder.

**NOTE:** Change `template.yaml` content with `spec.target=remote` to `spec.target=control-plane` for **single-cluster** mode as it follows:

```yaml
spec:
  target: control-plane
  channel: regular
```

4. Apply the module template to the K8s cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f template.yaml
```

5. Deploy the `nats` module by adding it to `kyma` custom resource `spec.modules`:

```sh
kubectl edit -n kyma-system kyma default-kyma
```
The spec part should have the following:
```yaml
...
spec:
  modules:
  - name: nats
...
```

6. Check whether your modules is deployed properly:

Check nats resource if it has ready state:
```shell
kubectl get -n kyma-system nats
```

Check Kyma resource if it has ready state:
```shell
kubectl get -n kyma-system kyma
```
If they don't have ready state, one can troubleshoot it by checking the pods under `nats-manager-system` namespace where the module is installed:
```shell
kubectl get pods -n nats-manager-system
```

**Uninstalling controller with [Kyma Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/kyma-project/lifecycle-manager/tree/main)**

1. Delete nats from `kyma` resource `spec.modules` `kubectl edit -n kyma-system kyma default-kyma`:

2. Check `nats` resource and module namespace whether they are deleted

```shell
kubectl get -n kyma-system nats
```
