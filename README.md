# NATS Manager

Manages the lifecycle of a NATS JetStream deployment.

## Description

NATS Manager is a standard Kubernetes operator that observes the state of NATS JetStream deployment and reconciles its state according to the desired state.

### How It Works

This project aims to follow the [Kubernetes Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/), which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached in the cluster.

This project is scaffolded using [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io).

## Installation

1. To install the latest version of the NATS manager in your cluster, run:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kyma-project/nats-manager/releases/latest/download/nats-manager.yaml
   ```

2. To install the latest version of the default NATS CR in your cluster, run:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kyma-project/nats-manager/releases/latest/download/nats-default-cr.yaml
   ```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/)
- [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)
- Access to Kubernetes cluster ([k3d](https://k3d.io/) / Kubernetes)

### Run NATS Manager locally

1. Download Go packages:

   ```sh
   go mod vendor && go mod tidy
   ```

2. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

   ```sh
   make install
   ```

3. Run your NATS Manager (this will run in the foreground, so if you want to leave it running, switch to a new terminal).

   ```sh
   make run
   ```

    **NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Run tests

Run the unit and integration tests:

```sh
make generate-and-test
```

### Linting

1. Fix common lint issues:

   ```sh
   make imports
   make fmt
   ```

2. Run lint check:

   ```sh
   make lint
   ```

### Modify the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

> **NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets.

For more information, see the [Kubebuilder documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html).

### Build container images

Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<container-registry>/nats-manager:<tag> # If using docker, <container-registry> is your username.
```

> **NOTE:**  Run the following for MacBook M1 devices:
>
> ```sh
> make docker-buildx IMG=<container-registry>/nats-manager:<tag>
> ```

## Deployment

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [k3d](https://k3d.io/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

> **NOTE:** Your NATS Manager automatically uses the current context in your kubeconfig file, that is, whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows.

### Deploy in the Cluster

1. Download Go packages:

   ```sh
   go mod vendor && go mod tidy
   ```

2. Install the CRDs to the cluster:

   ```sh
   make install
   ```

3. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

   ```sh
   make docker-build docker-push IMG=<container-registry>/nats-manager:<tag>
   ```

4. Deploy the `nats-manager` controller to the cluster:

   ```sh
   make deploy IMG=<container-registry>/nats-manager:<tag>
   ```

5. [Optional] Install NATS Custom Resource:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f config/samples/eventing-nats-eval.yaml
    ```

### Undeploy NATS Manager

Undeploy the NATS Manager from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

## E2E Tests

> **NOTE:** Because the E2E tests need a Kubernetes cluster to run on, they are separated from the remaining tests and are only executed if the `e2e` build tags are passed.

For the E2E tests, provide a Kubernetes cluster and run:

```shell
make e2e IMG=<container-registry>/nats-manager:<tag>
```

If you already have deployed the NATS-Manager in your cluster, you can simply run:

```shell
make e2e-only
```

To adjust the log level, use the environment variable `E2E_LOG_LEVEL`. It accepts the values `debug`, `info`, `warn` and `error`. The default value is `debug`. To set the level, enter:

```shell
export E2E_LOG_LEVEL="error"
```

The E2E test consists of four consecutive steps. You can run them individually as well.

1. To set up a NATS CR and check that it and all correlated resources like Pods, Services and PVCs are set up as expected, run:

   ```shell
   make e2e-setup
   ```

2. To execute a [bench test](https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/nats-tools/nats_cli/natsbench) on the NATS-Server, run:

   ```shell
   make e2e-bench
   ```

   This relies on the setup from `make e2e-setup`.

   > **NOTE:** Running this on slow hardware like CI systems or k3d clusters results in poor performance. However, this is still a great tool to simply show that NATS JetStream is in an operational configuration.

3. To check that the internals of the NATS-Server are healthy and configured as expected, run:

   ```shell
   make e2e-nats-server
   ```

   This will rely on the setup from `make e2e-setup`.

4. To clean up the test environment and to check that all resources correlated to the NATS CR are removed, run:

   ```shell
   make e2e-cleanup
   ```
